## Week 0 Journal Articles

- [Alston & Rick, 2021: A Beginner's Guide to Conducting Reproducible Researchs](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.1801)
- [McDermott et. al., 2021: Reproducibility in machine learning for health research: Still a ways to go](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33762434/)


## Course Materials

- R for Data Science by Wickham & Grolemund (freely available from authors [online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)).
- Hands on Machine learning for R by Boehmke & Greenwell (freely available from authors [online](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/)).
- Text Mining with R by Julia Slige & Davin Robinson (freely available from authors [online](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)).

Unfortunately, this course will not be able to give a comprehensive training in R.
However, there are lots of available R resources online to help your training (e.g., [Harvard's Chan Schools Introductory Course](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/IntroR/) or Roger Peng's [Coursera courses](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)).
R also has some of the best library documentation with a standardised requirement of full manuals and vignettes required to list libraries on the main repositories (e.g., CRAN or Bioconducter).
